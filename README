ABOUT THIS FORK:
A new WMFS2 seems to be extremely boring and lacks a lot of functionality:
EWMH, Xft fonts, always_on_top, and tons of others.
So for me brilliant wmfs-1 is the best option to use.
Every time I've made a new OS installation it took some hours to
re-write and improve wmfs for me.
Thus I decided to keep all of my changes here.
Therefore I modestly add my name to a contributors list below.
